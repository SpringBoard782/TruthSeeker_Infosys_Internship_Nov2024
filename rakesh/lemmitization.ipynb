No, not because he s orange with something that can only be described as an endangered species on his head, but rather because of his attitude towards life and how he apparently thinks people and things should be treated. Just by listening to his hissy fit over the Fox News debate, he has to make it about ratings and how he s really the thing that drives the entire event. To put it mildly he s full of himself, to be absolutely accurate, he s an egomaniac with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.And this isn t anything new for Trump. The Republican frontrunner has always been this braggadocios character who sees himself as the absolute best at everything and thinks everything he touches turns to gold. If he had a nice personality, many people would be able to look past this sort of ego, but since he s also an ass, well, people are going to call him out on it.The folks over at Sesame Street did just that back in 2005 when they created the character  Donald Grump  that Oscar the Grouch and all the other trash-loving grouches looked up to and admired. They put the word  GRUMP  all over everything, just like Trump does with his name. Oscar the Grouch in the introduction leading up the appearance of  Grump  explains to show staple Maria: Donald Grump happens to have the most trash of any grouch in the world  His name is on every piece of trash in town. Then after a brilliant song completely satirizing Trump,  Donald Grump  emerges and is everything you d ever imagine the muppet to be, with lines like: Who s name equals TRASH, to you and to me?  and the Grump saying  Who do you wish you all could be? Elmo s even turned down from being Mr. Grump s helper because he s  too nice.  However, Grump changes his mind when he hears Elmo is  nice AND annoying.  Qualities both Grump and Trump know help manipulate people to his fancy. Grump also yells at Maria when he doesn t like what she says by saying,  Scram, you re fired!  And when she says,  you can t fire me  he says,  I just did.  Which is all very foreshadowing to the revelation that Trump truly wants all Latinos to scram.But enough of me explaining what happens. The entire thing is just pure comedy gold and absolutely accurate.Enjoy.Video/Featured image: YouTube\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\\u2019s social media director Dan Scavino broke the law in April in calling for Trump supporters to defeat a Republican congressman at the polls, according to a letter from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. The office found that Scavino had violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits executive branch employees from engaging in some forms of political activity, and it issued a warning to him, it said in the letter. Politico on Friday was the first to report on the contents of the June 5 letter, which was delivered to an organization that had brought a complaint. In a tweet on April 1, Scavino had urged voters to defeat Republican Representative Justin Amash. Amash is a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which had helped beat back an early version of a healthcare reform bill that was a top priority for the president. \\u201c@justinamash is a big liability. #TrumpTrain, defeat him in primary,\\u201d Scavino tweeted. \\u201cMr. Scavino has been advised that if in the future he engages in prohibited political activity while employed in a position covered by the Hatch Act, we will consider such activity to be a willful and knowing violation of the law,\\u201d Ana Galindo-Marrone, chief of the Office of Special Counsel\\u2019s Hatch Act Unit, wrote in the letter. The office is an agency independent from the Justice Department that investigates acts in which government employees commit \\u201cprohibited personnel practices.\\u201d   \",\n          \"Donald Trump is seriously stupid.Considering all of the sexual assault allegations against him, the fact that he wants to bang his daughter, the fact that he has hit on teen girls, and talked about dating a girl when she was just ten-years old, one would think Trump would know better than to bring a girl on stage at one of his rallies.But that s exactly what he did on Monday night when he invited the child to the podium. Trump then picked her up, told her how beautiful she is and then tried to kiss her repeatedly, including on the lips, which the girl clearly did NOT appreciate. You can see it on her face as she tries to avoid Trump s lips and then runs back to her parents.Here s the video via YouTube.The optics here are absolutely terrible. If Trump had done this a year ago this probably wouldn t be much of a story. But we are three weeks out from Election Day and Donald Trump is embroiled in a mountain of sexual assault allegations and is still experiencing fallout because of his comments about groping women and not waiting to kiss women he considers  beautiful.  Apparently, that disgusting personal policy includes little girls, too.Of course, Trump trying to kiss a little girl horrified America, and they let Trump know about it on Twitter.About the gross video of Trump trying to kiss a little girl against her will: I don t even try to hug my daughter when she s not feeling it.  Bearded Tombstoner (@beardedstoner) October 18, 2016That s right children! Do not let creepy men like Trump force you to kiss them! Good job! Tonight via @GoAngelo pic.twitter.com/7uXzme2oKh  RiotWomenn (@riotwomennn) October 18, 2016Given what we know about Trump, I don t find the gif of the little girl pulling away from his kiss funny. Like, at all.  Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) October 18, 2016I ll admit, I wasn t ready to see Trump trying to kiss a little black girl on the mouth. Who the hell does that to someone else s child?  Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) October 18, 2016This is extremely painful to watch. That poor girl was so uncomfortable.
