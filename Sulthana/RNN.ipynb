reportedly ran the MaraLago resort in Palm Beach is any indication if he wins he will be taking full advantage of every spy agency in his charge just for his own agendaAccording to six former employees at the resort Trump had a telephone console in his room that allowed him to tap into every single phone in the place He often listened in on staff calls but he could also listen in on guest calls although the GOP frontrunner s spokeswoman denies itAccording to Buzzfeed who spoke to six former employees four of whom spoke under the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements this is indeed true Those four said he listened in from the private room he keeps during the mid2000sThey said he listened in on calls between club employees or in some cases between staff and guests None of them knew of Trump eavesdropping on guests or members talking on private calls with people who were not employees of MaraLago They also said that Trump could eavesdrop only on calls made on the club s landlines and not on calls made from guests  cell phonesEach of these four sources said they personally saw the telephone console which some referred to as a switchboard in Trump s bedroomNone of the four supports Trump s bid for president All said they enjoyed their time working at MaraLagoThe two other employees did not wish to remain anonymous They are Trump s former butler the one who wants Obama killed and Trump s former security director both of whom support Trump s run for president said that the console was only to make phone callsTrump the presumptive Republican nominee is running at a time when Americans are increasingly concerned about surveillance   both by the government and by their employers Some of his own campaign staff feared that their offices in Trump Tower in New York might be bugged the New York Times reported last month Trump has backed the NSA s bulk collection of metadata telling conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that  I tend to err on the side of security  Trump added  I assume when I pick up my telephone people are listening to my conversations anyway if you want to know the truth If Trump was listening in on guests  calls that was certainly a violation of Florida law The law is less clear on calls involving employees but since both parties in Florida need to be notified if the second party is not an employee that is legally murky at bestThis accusation is frightening I have always been of the opinion that Trump is running for the job of dictator hence his admiration of Putin and Kim Jong Un This does not bode well All I can say is I hope Hillary Clinton s offices are locked down tight or we ll have another Watergate on our handsFeatured image via John Moore at Getty Images\",\n          \"Cbc toronto  november 20

reportedly ran the MaraLago resort in Palm Beach is any indication if he wins he will be taking full advantage of every spy agency in his charge just for his own agendaAccording to six former employees at the resort Trump had a telephone console in his room that allowed him to tap into every single phone in the place He often listened in on staff calls but he could also listen in on guest calls although the GOP frontrunner s spokeswoman denies itAccording to Buzzfeed who spoke to six former employees four of whom spoke under the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements this is indeed true Those four said he listened in from the private room he keeps during the mid2000sThey said he listened in on calls between club employees or in some cases between staff and guests None of them knew of Trump eavesdropping on guests or members talking on private calls with people who were not employees of MaraLago They also said that Trump could eavesdrop only on calls made on the club s landlines and not on calls made from guests  cell phonesEach of these four sources said they personally saw the telephone console which some referred to as a switchboard in Trump s bedroomNone of the four supports Trump s bid for president All said they enjoyed their time working at MaraLagoThe two other employees did not wish to remain anonymous They are Trump s former butler the one who wants Obama killed and Trump s former security director both of whom support Trump s run for president said that the console was only to make phone callsTrump the presumptive Republican nominee is running at a time when Americans are increasingly concerned about surveillance   both by the government and by their employers Some of his own campaign staff feared that their offices in Trump Tower in New York might be bugged the New York Times reported last month Trump has backed the NSA s bulk collection of metadata telling conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that  I tend to err on the side of security  Trump added  I assume when I pick up my telephone people are listening to my conversations anyway if you want to know the truth If Trump was listening in on guests  calls that was certainly a violation of Florida law The law is less clear on calls involving employees but since both parties in Florida need to be notified if the second party is not an employee that is legally murky at bestThis accusation is frightening I have always been of the opinion that Trump is running for the job of dictator hence his admiration of Putin and Kim Jong Un This does not bode well All I can say is I hope Hillary Clinton s offices are locked down tight or we ll have another Watergate on our handsFeatured image via John Moore at Getty Images\",\n          \"Cbc toronto  november 20

reportedly ran the MaraLago resort in Palm Beach is any indication if he wins he will be taking full advantage of every spy agency in his charge just for his own agendaAccording to six former employees at the resort Trump had a telephone console in his room that allowed him to tap into every single phone in the place He often listened in on staff calls but he could also listen in on guest calls although the GOP frontrunner s spokeswoman denies itAccording to Buzzfeed who spoke to six former employees four of whom spoke under the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements this is indeed true Those four said he listened in from the private room he keeps during the mid2000sThey said he listened in on calls between club employees or in some cases between staff and guests None of them knew of Trump eavesdropping on guests or members talking on private calls with people who were not employees of MaraLago They also said that Trump could eavesdrop only on calls made on the club s landlines and not on calls made from guests  cell phonesEach of these four sources said they personally saw the telephone console which some referred to as a switchboard in Trump s bedroomNone of the four supports Trump s bid for president All said they enjoyed their time working at MaraLagoThe two other employees did not wish to remain anonymous They are Trump s former butler the one who wants Obama killed and Trump s former security director both of whom support Trump s run for president said that the console was only to make phone callsTrump the presumptive Republican nominee is running at a time when Americans are increasingly concerned about surveillance   both by the government and by their employers Some of his own campaign staff feared that their offices in Trump Tower in New York might be bugged the New York Times reported last month Trump has backed the NSA s bulk collection of metadata telling conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that  I tend to err on the side of security  Trump added  I assume when I pick up my telephone people are listening to my conversations anyway if you want to know the truth If Trump was listening in on guests  calls that was certainly a violation of Florida law The law is less clear on calls involving employees but since both parties in Florida need to be notified if the second party is not an employee that is legally murky at bestThis accusation is frightening I have always been of the opinion that Trump is running for the job of dictator hence his admiration of Putin and Kim Jong Un This does not bode well All I can say is I hope Hillary Clinton s offices are locked down tight or we ll have another Watergate on our handsFeatured image via John Moore at Getty Images\",\n          \"Cbc toronto  november 20
